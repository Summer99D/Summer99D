-  Hi, I’m Samar, but I go by the name Summer as well!
- I got my master's at University of Chicago, studying Public Policy and specializing data analytics. 
-  I’m interested in drawing data-backed conclusions, simplify facts and figures and visualize them!
- My favorite thing in the world is to help people and I believe helping is much more accurate done with data analysis.
  
-  I have currently mastered machine learning and data analysis in Python and R and am currently focusing on HPC, especially AWS. 
-  I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects, data visualizations and research projects. 
-  How to reach me:
my email: samarneg@uchicago.edu AND samardara1401@gmail.com

-  Fun fact: I can speak five languages and I am a different person in each of them.
